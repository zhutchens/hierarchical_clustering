## Current Usage
This paper and repository is currently in use for my undergraduate capstone project, ITSC 4990 - Undergraduate Research. I forked this repository to experiment with how DEBRA can be used with electronic textbooks and fictional books, including an electronic data structures textbook and Harry Potter books. Experimentation is ongoing and we are looking to see if the algorithm can be modified or improved to better suit academic textbooks. The CSV file for the data structures textbook can be found in the data folder of this repository, and the original pdf file can be found at:
